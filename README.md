# NFT MarketPlace

**Description**:
This project demonstrates a basic NFT Marketplace use case. It has some smart contract that enables users mint, buy and sell NFTs. Users can interact with these on the frontend by uploading the image they want to mint, select a price for sale and users can buy. They can also see the list of all their NFT collections.
